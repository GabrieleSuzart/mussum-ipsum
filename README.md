# Mussum Ipsum v2.0.1

[mussumipsum.com](http://mussumipsum.com)

This is the initial project of the new version for Mussum Ipsum.

--
I'm working on that and my idea is that, when finished, you could use this script to make your own customized Lorem Ipsum, or whatever you want to.

Thanks, and let's Finish that shit! ;)
